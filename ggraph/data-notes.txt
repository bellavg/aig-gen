GraphEBM
virtual edge and node type -> so for all of them?

Therefore, for a dataset, X∈{0,1}
n×(b+1)
  (where b is the number of actual node types) and A∈{0,1}
n×n×(c+1)
  (where c is the number of actual edge types).

  GraphAF does no edge

  GraphDF does no edge

  for all models

    last dimension of adj is no edge dim

    add none type for node padding so to pad to max nodes which is 64 then add a dimension which is none type
