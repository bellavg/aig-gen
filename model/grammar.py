# AIG grammar.


# AIG Attributes

# Input nodes and constant 0 nodes cannot be destinations

# the number of input nodes and output nodes must remain the same and all must appear. 

# all AND nodes  (the intermediate) can only have 2 incoming edges (fanins) but arbitrarily many outgoing

# all edges have to be either inverted or regular

# all edges go from source id to a larger id for target

# all output nodes have only one incoming connection, no outgoing edges (cannot be source)

# should have less than or equal to number of nodes of input graphs
